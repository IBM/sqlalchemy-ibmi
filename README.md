SQLAlchemy adapter for IBM i
=========

The IBM i SQLAlchemy adapter provides a [SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/) interface to Db2 for [IBM i](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_i).

**Please note that this project is still in active development and is not ready for use.** :rotating_light: 

```python
import sqlalchemy as sa

# see documentation for available connection options
# pass connection options in url query string, eg.
# engine = sa.create_engine("ibmi://user:pass@host?autocommit=true&timeout=10"
# find usage of create_engine database urls here
# https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/13/core/engines.html#database-urls
# this is the base connection which connects to *LOCAL on the host

engine = sa.create_engine("ibmi://user:pass@host")

cnxn = engine.connect()
metadata = sa.MetaData()
table = sa.Table('table_name', metadata, autoload=True, autoload_with=engine)

query = sa.select([table])

result = cnxn.execute(query)
result = result.fetchall()

# print first entry
print(result[0])

```

Known Limitations 
-------------------------------------------------------------
1) Non-standard SQL queries are not supported. e.g. "SELECT ? FROM TAB1"
2) For updations involving primary/foreign key references, the entries should be made in correct order. Integrity check is always on and thus the primary keys referenced by the foreign keys in the referencing tables should always exist in the parent table.
3) Unique key which contains nullable column not supported
4) UPDATE CASCADE for foreign keys not supported
5) DEFERRABLE INITIALLY deferred not supported
6) Subquery in ON clause of LEFT OUTER JOIN not supported
